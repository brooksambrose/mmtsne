Description: An implementation of multiple maps t-distributed stochastic
    neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Multiple maps t-SNE is a method for
    projecting high-dimensional data into several low-dimensional maps such that
    non-metric space properties are better preserved than they would be by a single
    map. Multiple maps t-SNE with only one map is equivalent to standard t-SNE.
    When projecting onto more than one map, multiple maps t-SNE estimates a set
    of latent weights that allow each point to contribute to one or more maps
    depending on similarity relationships in the original data. This
    implementation is a port of the original 'Matlab' library by Laurens van der
    Maaten.
